1. none was frustrating it was fun finding the differences
2. conventions are for streamlining keeping is all uniform so everyone can read it not just you
3. it's like a piece of paper with tape around it inside of a box

review
1. almost all were syntax errors (brackets,typos,miss comas)
2. Spell correctly or use diff to find the difference
3. padding is like the space before the border or tape .
4. The margin is my personal space how much room you need away from others
5. when you put your mouse over something it changes the color white
