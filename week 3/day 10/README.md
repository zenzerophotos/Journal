1. html was the easiest for me I think because it was just text didn't hve to make it do things. but I like it all>
2. javaS is crazy it's still like the 4th dimension just don't see it yet .

3. mozilla developer is where i keep ending up

1. I don't know yet ,but I will.
2. listen for mouse clicks hovers or whatever. and then take an appropriate action
3. it grabs the id or class with the corosponding name to it.

The java is still eluding me once I sit down and do it, make it work ,take it apart put it back together it'll make a lot more sense to me.
